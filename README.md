This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# description
This project is a presentation of the algorithm of finding the shortest path on a 2D board

It uses BFS traversal to find the shortest path.
i will add Heuristics to this logic to make it more efficient.

that would include both Dijkstra and A*

# usage

please draw any shape of obstacles between start and target node
then hit the button to find the shortest path
you can also change the size, then hit update settings
